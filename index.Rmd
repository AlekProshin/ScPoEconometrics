# Econometrics at ScPo - WORK IN PROGRESS

![](ScPo.jpg)

This is our book about Introductory Econometrics for 2nd year UGs at ScPo. We follow a practical approach with minimal reliance on maths and maximal reliance on practical learning.

On this first page we can explain a bit more about the course structure:

* how to communicate
* how many sessions etc
