Today we'll finally find out.


## $b_0$ and $b_1$ are *Estimates*

>* We repeatedly saw 
    $$ y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + e_i $$
>* `R` reports *estimates* $b_0$ and $b_1$. Both estimate underlying *population parameters* $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$
>* Estimates **always** come with some degree of uncertainty.
>* For example, increasing sample size $N$ to estimate the mean implies smaller and smaller variance of the estimate.
