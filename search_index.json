On this page we outline the course and present the Syllabus. This is still work in progress. Objective This course aims to teach you the basics of data analysis needed in a Social Sciences oriented University like SciencesPo. We purposefully start at a level that assumes no prior knowledge about statistics whatsoever. Our objective is to have you understand and be able to interpret linear regression analysis. We will not rely on maths and statistics, but practical learning in order to teach the main concepts. Syllabus and Requirements You can find the topics we want to go over in the left panel of this page. The later chapters are optional and depend on the speed with which we will proceed eventually. Chapters 1-4 are the core material of the course. The only requirement is that you bring your own personal computer to each session. We will be using the free statistical computing language R very intensively. Before coming to each session, you should update computer code associated to the course by executing the following three commands in your R console: if (!require(&quot;devtools&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) install_github(repo = &quot;ScPoEcon/ScPoEconometrics&quot;) Course Structure This course is taught in several different groups across various campuses of SciencesPo. All groups will go over the same material, do the same exercises, and will have the same assessments. Groups meet once per week for 2 hours. The main purpose of the weekly meetings is to clarify any questions, and to work together through tutorials. The little theory we need will be covered in this book, and you are expected to read through this in your own time before coming to class. This Book and Other Material What you are looking at is an online textbook. You can therefore look at it in your browser (as you are doing just now), but you can also download it as a pdf file or as an epub file for your ebook-reader. We don’t have any ambition to actually produce and publish a book for now, so you should just see this as a way to disseminate our lecture notes to you. The second part of course material next to the book is an extensive suite of tutorials and interactive demonstrations, which are all contained in the R package that builds this book (and which you installed by issuing the above commands). Open Source The book and all other content for this course are hosted under an open source license on github. You can contribute to the book by just clicking on the appropriate edit symbol in the top bar of this page. Assessments We will assess participation in class and conduct a final exam. Team Communication We will communicate exclusively on our slack app. You will get an invitation email to join in due course. "],
["R-intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to R 1.1 Getting Started 1.2 Basic Calculations 1.3 Getting Help 1.4 Installing Packages 1.5 Data Types 1.6 Data Structures 1.7 Programming Basics", " Chapter 1 Introduction to R 1.1 Getting Started R is both a programming language and software environment for statistical computing, which is free and open-source. To get started, you will need to install two pieces of software: R, the actual programming language. Chose your operating system, and select the most recent version, 3.5.0. RStudio, an excellent IDE for working with R. Note, you must have R installed to use RStudio. RStudio is simply an interface used to interact with R. The popularity of R is on the rise, and everyday it becomes a better tool for statistical analysis. It even generated this book! (A skill you will learn in this course.) There are many good resources for learning R. The following few chapters will serve as a whirlwind introduction to R. They are by no means meant to be a complete reference for the R language, but simply an introduction to the basics that we will need along the way. Several of the more important topics will be re-stressed as they are actually needed for analyses. These introductory R chapters may feel like an overwhelming amount of information. You are not expected to pick up everything the first time through. You should try all of the code from these chapters, then return to them a number of times as you return to the concepts when performing analyses. R is used both for software development and data analysis. We will operate in a grey area, somewhere between these two tasks. Our main goal will be to analyze data, but we will also perform programming exercises that help illustrate certain concepts. RStudio has a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. A list of these can be found using a keyboard shortcut – the keyboard shortcut to rule them all: On Windows: Alt + Shift + K On Mac: Option + Shift + K The RStudio team has developed a number of “cheatsheets” for working with both R and RStudio. This particular cheatseet for Base R will summarize many of the concepts in this document. When programming, it is often a good practice to follow a style guide. (Where do spaces go? Tabs or spaces? Underscores or CamelCase when naming variables?) No style guide is “correct” but it helps to be aware of what others do. The more import thing is to be consistent within your own code. Hadley Wickham Style Guide from Advanced R Google Style Guide For this course, our main deviation from these two guides is the use of = in place of &lt;-. (More on that later.) 1.2 Basic Calculations To get started, we’ll use R like a simple calculator. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division Math R Result \\(3 + 2\\) 3 + 2 5 \\(3 - 2\\) 3 - 2 1 \\(3 \\cdot2\\) 3 * 2 6 \\(3 / 2\\) 3 / 2 1.5 Exponents Math R Result \\(3^2\\) 3 ^ 2 9 \\(2^{(-3)}\\) 2 ^ (-3) 0.125 \\(100^{1/2}\\) 100 ^ (1 / 2) 10 \\(\\sqrt{100}\\) sqrt(100) 10 Mathematical Constants Math R Result \\(\\pi\\) pi 3.1415927 \\(e\\) exp(1) 2.7182818 Logarithms Note that we will use \\(\\ln\\) and \\(\\log\\) interchangeably to mean the natural logarithm. There is no ln() in R, instead it uses log() to mean the natural logarithm. Math R Result \\(\\log(e)\\) log(exp(1)) 1 \\(\\log_{10}(1000)\\) log10(1000) 3 \\(\\log_{2}(8)\\) log2(8) 3 \\(\\log_{4}(16)\\) log(16, base = 4) 2 Trigonometry Math R Result \\(\\sin(\\pi / 2)\\) sin(pi / 2) 1 \\(\\cos(0)\\) cos(0) 1 1.3 Getting Help In using R as a calculator, we have seen a number of functions: sqrt(), exp(), log() and sin(). To get documentation about a function in R, simply put a question mark in front of the function name, or call the function help(function) and RStudio will display the documentation, for example: ?log ?sin ?paste ?lm help(lm) # help() is equivalent help(ggplot,package=&quot;ggplot2&quot;) # show help from a certain package Frequently one of the most difficult things to do when learning R is asking for help. First, you need to decide to ask for help, then you need to know how to ask for help. Your very first line of defense should be to Google your error message or a short description of your issue. (The ability to solve problems using this method is quickly becoming an extremely valuable skill.) If that fails, and it eventually will, you should ask for help. There are a number of things you should include when emailing an instructor, or posting to a help website such as Stack Overflow. Describe what you expect the code to do. State the end goal you are trying to achieve. (Sometimes what you expect the code to do, is not what you want to actually do.) Provide the full text of any errors you have received. Provide enough code to recreate the error. Often for the purpose of this course, you could simply email your entire .R or .Rmd file. Sometimes it is also helpful to include a screenshot of your entire RStudio window when the error occurs. If you follow these steps, you will get your issue resolved much quicker, and possibly learn more in the process. Do not be discouraged by running into errors and difficulties when learning R. (Or any technical skill.) It is simply part of the learning process. 1.4 Installing Packages R comes with a number of built-in functions and datasets, but one of the main strengths of R as an open-source project is its package system. Packages add additional functions and data. Frequently if you want to do something in R, and it is not available by default, there is a good chance that there is a package that will fulfill your needs. To install a package, use the install.packages() function. Think of this as buying a recipe book from the store, bringing it home, and putting it on your shelf. install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Once a package is installed, it must be loaded into your current R session before being used. Think of this as taking the book off of the shelf and opening it up to read. library(ggplot2) Once you close R, all the packages are closed and put back on the imaginary shelf. The next time you open R, you do not have to install the package again, but you do have to load any packages you intend to use by invoking library(). 1.5 Data Types R has a number of basic data types. Numeric Also known as Double. The default type when dealing with numbers. Examples: 1, 1.0, 42.5 Integer Examples: 1L, 2L, 42L Complex Example: 4 + 2i Logical Two possible values: TRUE and FALSE You can also use T and F, but this is not recommended. NA is also considered logical. Character Examples: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;Statistics&quot;, &quot;1 plus 2.&quot; Categorical or factor A mixture of integer and character. A factor variable assigns a label to a numeric value. For example factor(x=c(0,1),labels=c(&quot;male&quot;,&quot;female&quot;)) assigns the string male to the numeric values 0, and the string female to the value 1. 1.6 Data Structures R also has a number of basic data structures. A data structure is either homogeneous (all elements are of the same data type) or heterogeneous (elements can be of more than one data type). Dimension Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1 Vector List 2 Matrix Data Frame 3+ Array 1.6.1 Vectors Many operations in R make heavy use of vectors. Vectors in R are indexed starting at 1. That is what the [1] in the output is indicating, that the first element of the row being displayed is the first element of the vector. Larger vectors will start additional rows with [*] where * is the index of the first element of the row. Possibly the most common way to create a vector in R is using the c() function, which is short for “combine.”&quot; As the name suggests, it combines a list of elements separated by commas. c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 Here R simply outputs this vector. If we would like to store this vector in a variable we can do so with the assignment operator =. In this case the variable x now holds the vector we just created, and we can access the vector by typing x. x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) x ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 As an aside, there is a long history of the assignment operator in R, partially due to the keys available on the keyboards of the creators of the S language. (Which preceded R.) For simplicity we will use =, but know that often you will see &lt;- as the assignment operator. The pros and cons of these two are well beyond the scope of this book, but know that for our purposes you will have no issue if you simply use =. If you are interested in the weird cases where the difference matters, check out The R Inferno. If you wish to use &lt;-, you will still need to use =, however only for argument passing. Some users like to keep assignment (&lt;-) and argument passing (=) separate. No matter what you choose, the more important thing is that you stay consistent. Also, if working on a larger collaborative project, you should use whatever style is already in place. Because vectors must contains elements that are all the same type, R will automatically coerce to a single type when attempting to create a vector that combines multiple types. c(42, &quot;Statistics&quot;, TRUE) ## [1] &quot;42&quot; &quot;Statistics&quot; &quot;TRUE&quot; c(42, TRUE) ## [1] 42 1 Frequently you may wish to create a vector based on a sequence of numbers. The quickest and easiest way to do this is with the : operator, which creates a sequence of integers between two specified integers. (y = 1:100) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ## [18] 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 ## [35] 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 ## [52] 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 ## [69] 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 ## [86] 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 Here we see R labeling the rows after the first since this is a large vector. Also, we see that by putting parentheses around the assignment, R both stores the vector in a variable called y and automatically outputs y to the console. Note that scalars do not exists in R. They are simply vectors of length 1. 2 ## [1] 2 If we want to create a sequence that isn’t limited to integers and increasing by 1 at a time, we can use the seq() function. seq(from = 1.5, to = 4.2, by = 0.1) ## [1] 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 ## [18] 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 We will discuss functions in detail later, but note here that the input labels from, to, and by are optional. seq(1.5, 4.2, 0.1) ## [1] 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 ## [18] 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 Another common operation to create a vector is rep(), which can repeat a single value a number of times. rep(&quot;A&quot;, times = 10) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; The rep() function can be used to repeat a vector some number of times. rep(x, times = 3) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 We have now seen four different ways to create vectors: c() : seq() rep() So far we have mostly used them in isolation, but they are often used together. c(x, rep(seq(1, 9, 2), 3), c(1, 2, 3), 42, 2:4) ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 1 2 ## [24] 3 42 2 3 4 The length of a vector can be obtained with the length() function. length(x) ## [1] 6 length(y) ## [1] 100 1.6.1.1 Task Let’s try this out! Create a vector of five ones, i.e. [1,1,1,1,1] rep(1,5) Notice that the colon operator a:b is just short for construct a sequence from a to b. Create a vector the counts down from 10 to 0, i.e. it looks like 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0! 10:0 the rep function takes additional arguments times (as above), and each, which tells you how often each element should be repeated (as opposed to the entire input vector). Use rep to create a vector that looks like this: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 rep(1:3,times=2,each=3) 1.6.1.2 Subsetting To subset a vector, i.e. to choose only some elements of it, we use square brackets, []. x ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 x[1] ## [1] 1 x[3] ## [1] 5 We see that x[1] returns the first element, and x[3] returns the third element. x[-2] ## [1] 1 5 7 8 9 We can also exclude certain indexes, in this case the second element. x[1:3] ## [1] 1 3 5 x[c(1,3,4)] ## [1] 1 5 7 Lastly we see that we can subset based on a vector of indices. All of the above are subsetting a vector using a vector of indexes. (Remember a single number is still a vector.) We could instead use a vector of logical values. z = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) z ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE x[z] ## [1] 1 3 7 8 1.6.2 Vectorization One of the biggest strengths of R is its use of vectorized operations. This means, operations which work on - and are optimized for - entire vectors. x = 1:10 # a vector x + 1 # add scalar ## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 2 * x # multiply all elts by 2 ## [1] 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 ^ x # take 2 to the x as exponents ## [1] 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 sqrt(x) # compute the square root of all elements in x ## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068 2.449490 2.645751 ## [8] 2.828427 3.000000 3.162278 log(x) ## [1] 0.0000000 0.6931472 1.0986123 1.3862944 1.6094379 1.7917595 1.9459101 ## [8] 2.0794415 2.1972246 2.3025851 We see that when a function like log() is called on a vector x, a vector is returned which has applied the function to each element of the vector x. 1.6.3 Logical Operators Operator Summary Example Result x &lt; y x less than y 3 &lt; 42 TRUE x &gt; y x greater than y 3 &gt; 42 FALSE x &lt;= y x less than or equal to y 3 &lt;= 42 TRUE x &gt;= y x greater than or equal to y 3 &gt;= 42 FALSE x == y xequal to y 3 == 42 FALSE x != y x not equal to y 3 != 42 TRUE !x not x !(3 &gt; 42) TRUE x | y x or y (3 &gt; 42) | TRUE TRUE x &amp; y x and y (3 &lt; 4) &amp; ( 42 &gt; 13) TRUE In R, logical operators are vectorized. x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) x &gt; 3 ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE x &lt; 3 ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE x == 3 ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE x != 3 ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE x == 3 &amp; x != 3 ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE x == 3 | x != 3 ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE This is extremely useful for subsetting. x[x &gt; 3] ## [1] 5 7 8 9 x[x != 3] ## [1] 1 5 7 8 9 coercion sum(x &gt; 3) ## [1] 4 as.numeric(x &gt; 3) ## [1] 0 0 1 1 1 1 Here we see that using the sum() function on a vector of logical TRUE and FALSE values that is the result of x &gt; 3 results in a numeric result. R is first automatically coercing the logical to numeric where TRUE is 1 and FALSE is 0. This coercion from logical to numeric happens for most mathematical operations. which(x &gt; 3) ## [1] 3 4 5 6 x[which(x &gt; 3)] ## [1] 5 7 8 9 max(x) ## [1] 9 which(x == max(x)) ## [1] 6 which.max(x) ## [1] 6 1.6.4 More Vectorization x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) y = 1:100 x + 2 ## [1] 3 5 7 9 10 11 x + rep(2, 6) ## [1] 3 5 7 9 10 11 x &gt; 3 ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE x &gt; rep(3, 6) ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE x + y ## Warning in x + y: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object ## length ## [1] 2 5 8 11 13 15 8 11 14 17 19 21 14 17 20 23 25 ## [18] 27 20 23 26 29 31 33 26 29 32 35 37 39 32 35 38 41 ## [35] 43 45 38 41 44 47 49 51 44 47 50 53 55 57 50 53 56 ## [52] 59 61 63 56 59 62 65 67 69 62 65 68 71 73 75 68 71 ## [69] 74 77 79 81 74 77 80 83 85 87 80 83 86 89 91 93 86 ## [86] 89 92 95 97 99 92 95 98 101 103 105 98 101 104 107 length(x) ## [1] 6 length(y) ## [1] 100 length(y) / length(x) ## [1] 16.66667 (x + y) - y ## Warning in x + y: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object ## length ## [1] 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 ## [36] 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 ## [71] 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 8 9 1 3 5 7 y = 1:60 x + y ## [1] 2 5 8 11 13 15 8 11 14 17 19 21 14 17 20 23 25 27 20 23 26 29 31 ## [24] 33 26 29 32 35 37 39 32 35 38 41 43 45 38 41 44 47 49 51 44 47 50 53 ## [47] 55 57 50 53 56 59 61 63 56 59 62 65 67 69 length(y) / length(x) ## [1] 10 rep(x, 10) + y ## [1] 2 5 8 11 13 15 8 11 14 17 19 21 14 17 20 23 25 27 20 23 26 29 31 ## [24] 33 26 29 32 35 37 39 32 35 38 41 43 45 38 41 44 47 49 51 44 47 50 53 ## [47] 55 57 50 53 56 59 61 63 56 59 62 65 67 69 all(x + y == rep(x, 10) + y) ## [1] TRUE identical(x + y, rep(x, 10) + y) ## [1] TRUE # ?any # ?all.equal 1.6.5 Matrices R can also be used for matrix calculations. Matrices have rows and columns containing a single data type. In a matrix, the order of rows and columns is important. (This is not true of data frames, which we will see later.) Matrices can be created using the matrix function. x = 1:9 x ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) X ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 Note here that we are using two different variables: lower case x, which stores a vector and capital X, which stores a matrix. (Following the usual mathematical convention.) We can do this because R is case sensitive. By default the matrix function reorders a vector into columns, but we can also tell R to use rows instead. Y = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) Y ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 7 8 9 We can also create a matrix of a specified dimension where every element is the same, in this case 0. Z = matrix(0, 2, 4) Z ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 0 0 0 Like vectors, matrices can be subsetted using square brackets, []. However, since matrices are two-dimensional, we need to specify both a row and a column when subsetting. X ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 7 ## [2,] 2 5 8 ## [3,] 3 6 9 X[1, 2] ## [1] 4 Here we accessed the element in the first row and the second column. We could also subset an entire row or column. X[1, ] ## [1] 1 4 7 X[, 2] ## [1] 4 5 6 We can also use vectors to subset more than one row or column at a time. Here we subset to the first and third column of the second row. X[2, c(1, 3)] ## [1] 2 8 Matrices can also be created by combining vectors as columns, using cbind, or combining vectors as rows, using rbind. x = 1:9 rev(x) ## [1] 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 rep(1, 9) ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 rbind(x, rev(x), rep(1, 9)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 cbind(col_1 = x, col_2 = rev(x), col_3 = rep(1, 9)) ## col_1 col_2 col_3 ## [1,] 1 9 1 ## [2,] 2 8 1 ## [3,] 3 7 1 ## [4,] 4 6 1 ## [5,] 5 5 1 ## [6,] 6 4 1 ## [7,] 7 3 1 ## [8,] 8 2 1 ## [9,] 9 1 1 When using rbind and cbind you can specify “argument” names that will be used as column names.

It is element by element multiplication. (Same for X / Y). Instead, matrix multiplication uses %*%. Other matrix functions include t() which gives the transpose of a matrix and solve() which returns the inverse of a square matrix if it is invertible.

We would expect this to return the identity matrix, however we see that this is not the case due to some computational issues. However, R also has the all.equal() function which checks for equality, with some small tolerance which accounts for some computational issues. The identical() function is used to check for exact equality. solve(Z) %*% Z ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1.000000e+00 -6.245005e-17 0.000000e+00 ## [2,] 8.326673e-17 1.000000e+00 5.551115e-17 ## [3,] 2.775558e-17 0.000000e+00 1.000000e+00 diag(3) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 all.equal(solve(Z) %*% Z, diag(3)) ## [1] TRUE R has a number of matrix specific functions for obtaining dimension and summary information.

We can extract the diagonal of a matrix. diag(Z) ## [1] 9 4 16 Or create a matrix with specified elements on the diagonal. (And 0 on the off-diagonals.) diag(1:5) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 2 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 3 0 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 4 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 5 Or, lastly, create a square matrix of a certain dimension with 1 for every element of the diagonal and 0 for the off-diagonals. diag(5) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 Calculations with Vectors and Matrices Certain operations in R, for example %*% have different behavior on vectors and matrices. To illustrate this, we will first create two vectors. a_vec = c(1, 2, 3) b_vec = c(2, 2, 2) Note that these are indeed vectors. They are not matrices. c(is.vector(a_vec), is.vector(b_vec)) ## [1] TRUE TRUE c(is.matrix(a_vec), is.matrix(b_vec)) ## [1] FALSE FALSE When this is the case, the %*% operator is used to calculate the dot product, also know as the inner product of the two vectors. The dot product of vectors \\(\\boldsymbol{a} = \\lbrack a_1, a_2, \\cdots a_n \\rbrack\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{b} = \\lbrack b_1, b_2, \\cdots b_n \\rbrack\\) is defined to be \\[ \\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i b_i = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \\cdots a_n b_n. \\] a_vec %*% b_vec # inner product ## [,1] ## [1,] 12 a_vec %o% b_vec # outer product ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 2 2 2 ## [2,] 4 4 4 ## [3,] 6 6 6 The %o% operator is used to calculate the outer product of the two vectors. When vectors are coerced to become matrices, they are column vectors. So a vector of length \\(n\\) becomes an \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix after coercion. as.matrix(a_vec) ## [,1] ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 2 ## [3,] 3 If we use the %*% operator on matrices, %*% again performs the expected matrix multiplication. So you might expect the following to produce an error, because the dimensions are incorrect. as.matrix(a_vec) %*% b_vec ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 2 2 2 ## [2,] 4 4 4 ## [3,] 6 6 6 At face value this is a \\(3 \\times 1\\) matrix, multiplied by a \\(3 \\times 1\\) matrix. However, when b_vec is automatically coerced to be a matrix, R decided to make it a “row vector”, a \\(1 \\times 3\\) matrix, so that the multiplication has conformable dimensions. If we had coerced both, then R would produce an error. as.matrix(a_vec) %*% as.matrix(b_vec) Another way to calculate a dot product is with the crossprod() function. Given two vectors, the crossprod() function calculates their dot product. The function has a rather misleading name. crossprod(a_vec, b_vec) # inner product ## [,1] ## [1,] 12 tcrossprod(a_vec, b_vec) # outer product ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 2 2 2 ## [2,] 4 4 4 ## [3,] 6 6 6 These functions could be very useful later. When used with matrices \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) as arguments, it calculates \\[ X^\\top Y. \\] When dealing with linear models, the calculation \\[ X^\\top X \\] is used repeatedly. C_mat = matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 2, 3) D_mat = matrix(c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), 2, 3) This is useful both as a shortcut for a frequent calculation and as a more efficient implementation than using t() and %*%. crossprod(C_mat, D_mat) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 6 6 6 ## [2,] 14 14 14 ## [3,] 22 22 22 t(C_mat) %*% D_mat ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 6 6 6 ## [2,] 14 14 14 ## [3,] 22 22 22 all.equal(crossprod(C_mat, D_mat), t(C_mat) %*% D_mat) ## [1] TRUE crossprod(C_mat, C_mat) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 5 11 17 ## [2,] 11 25 39 ## [3,] 17 39 61 t(C_mat) %*% C_mat ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 5 11 17 ## [2,] 11 25 39 ## [3,] 17 39 61 all.equal(crossprod(C_mat, C_mat), t(C_mat) %*% C_mat) ## [1] TRUE 1.6.6 Lists A list is a one-dimensional heterogeneous data structure. So it is indexed like a vector with a single integer value, but each element can contain an element of any type. Lists are extremely useful and versatile objects, so make sure you understand their useage: # creation list(42, &quot;Hello&quot;, TRUE) ## [[1]] ## [1] 42 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;Hello&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] TRUE ex_list = list( a = c(1, 2, 3, 4), b = TRUE, c = &quot;Hello!&quot;, d = function(arg = 42) {print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)}, e = diag(5) ) Lists can be subset using two syntaxes, the $ operator, and square brackets []. The $ operator returns a named element of a list. The [] syntax returns a list, while the [[]] returns an element of a list. ex_list[1] returns a list contain the first element. ex_list[[1]] returns the first element of the list, in this case, a vector. # subsetting ex_list$e ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ex_list[1:2] ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 ## ## $b ## [1] TRUE ex_list[1] ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 ex_list[[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 ex_list[c(&quot;e&quot;, &quot;a&quot;)] ## $e ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ## ## $a ## [1] 1 2 3 4 ex_list[&quot;e&quot;] ## $e ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ex_list[[&quot;e&quot;]] ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 ex_list$d ## function(arg = 42) {print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)} ex_list$d(arg = 1) ## [1] &quot;Hello World!&quot; 1.6.7 Data Frames We have previously seen vectors and matrices for storing data as we introduced R. We will now introduce a data frame which will be the most common way that we store and interact with data in this course. example_data = data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), y = c(rep(&quot;Hello&quot;, 9), &quot;Goodbye&quot;), z = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5)) Unlike a matrix, which can be thought of as a vector rearranged into rows and columns, a data frame is not required to have the same data type for each element. A data frame is a list of vectors. So, each vector must contain the same data type, but the different vectors can store different data types. example_data ## x y z ## 1 1 Hello TRUE ## 2 3 Hello FALSE ## 3 5 Hello TRUE ## 4 7 Hello FALSE ## 5 9 Hello TRUE ## 6 1 Hello FALSE ## 7 3 Hello TRUE ## 8 5 Hello FALSE ## 9 7 Hello TRUE ## 10 9 Goodbye FALSE Unlike a list which has more flexibility, the elements of a data frame must all be vectors, and have the same length. Again, we access any given column with the $ operator: example_data$x ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 all.equal(length(example_data$x), length(example_data$y), length(example_data$z)) ## [1] TRUE str(example_data) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 10 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ x: num 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9 ## $ y: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Goodbye&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 ## $ z: logi TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE ... nrow(example_data) ## [1] 10 ncol(example_data) ## [1] 3 dim(example_data) ## [1] 10 3 The data.frame() function above is one way to create a data frame. We can also import data from various file types in into R, as well as use data stored in packages. The example data above can also be found here as a .csv file. To read this data into R, we would use the read_csv() function from the readr package. Note that R has a built in function read.csv() that operates very similarly. The readr function read_csv() has a number of advantages. For example, it is much faster reading larger data. It also uses the tibble package to read the data as a tibble. library(readr) example_data_from_csv = read_csv(&quot;data/example-data.csv&quot;) This particular line of code assumes that the file example_data.csv exists in a folder called data in your current working directory. example_data_from_csv ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## x y z ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 1 Hello TRUE ## 2 3 Hello FALSE ## 3 5 Hello TRUE ## 4 7 Hello FALSE ## 5 9 Hello TRUE ## 6 1 Hello FALSE ## 7 3 Hello TRUE ## 8 5 Hello FALSE ## 9 7 Hello TRUE ## 10 9 Goodbye FALSE A tibble is simply a data frame that prints with sanity. Notice in the output above that we are given additional information such as dimension and variable type. The as_tibble() function can be used to coerce a regular data frame to a tibble. library(tibble) example_data = as_tibble(example_data) example_data ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## x y z ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 1 Hello TRUE ## 2 3 Hello FALSE ## 3 5 Hello TRUE ## 4 7 Hello FALSE ## 5 9 Hello TRUE ## 6 1 Hello FALSE ## 7 3 Hello TRUE ## 8 5 Hello FALSE ## 9 7 Hello TRUE ## 10 9 Goodbye FALSE Alternatively, we could use the “Import Dataset” feature in RStudio which can be found in the environment window. (By default, the top-right pane of RStudio.) Once completed, this process will automatically generate the code to import a file. The resulting code will be shown in the console window. In recent versions of RStudio, read_csv() is used by default, thus reading in a tibble. Earlier we looked at installing packages, in particular the ggplot2 package. (A package for visualization. While not necessary for this course, it is quickly growing in popularity.) library(ggplot2) Inside the ggplot2 package is a dataset called mpg. By loading the package using the library() function, we can now access mpg. When using data from inside a package, there are three things we would generally like to do: Look at the raw data. Understand the data. (Where did it come from? What are the variables? Etc.) Visualize the data. To look at the data, we have two useful commands: head() and str(). data(mpg) # load dataset `mpg` from `ggplot2` package head(mpg, n = 10) ## # A tibble: 10 x 11 ## manufacturer model displ year cyl trans drv cty hwy fl ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 auto(l… f 18 29 p ## 2 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 manual… f 21 29 p ## 3 audi a4 2 2008 4 manual… f 20 31 p ## 4 audi a4 2 2008 4 auto(a… f 21 30 p ## 5 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 auto(l… f 16 26 p ## 6 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 manual… f 18 26 p ## 7 audi a4 3.1 2008 6 auto(a… f 18 27 p ## 8 audi a4 quat… 1.8 1999 4 manual… 4 18 26 p ## 9 audi a4 quat… 1.8 1999 4 auto(l… 4 16 25 p ## 10 audi a4 quat… 2 2008 4 manual… 4 20 28 p ## # ... with 1 more variable: class &lt;chr&gt; The function head() will display the first n observations of the data frame. The head() function was more useful before tibbles. Notice that mpg is a tibble already, so the output from head() indicates there are only 10 observations. Note that this applies to head(mpg, n = 10) and not mpg itself. Also note that tibbles print a limited number of rows and columns by default. The last line of the printed output indicates with rows and columns were omitted. mpg ## # A tibble: 234 x 11 ## manufacturer model displ year cyl trans drv cty hwy fl ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 auto(l… f 18 29 p ## 2 audi a4 1.8 1999 4 manual… f 21 29 p ## 3 audi a4 2 2008 4 manual… f 20 31 p ## 4 audi a4 2 2008 4 auto(a… f 21 30 p ## 5 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 auto(l… f 16 26 p ## 6 audi a4 2.8 1999 6 manual… f 18 26 p ## 7 audi a4 3.1 2008 6 auto(a… f 18 27 p ## 8 audi a4 quat… 1.8 1999 4 manual… 4 18 26 p ## 9 audi a4 quat… 1.8 1999 4 auto(l… 4 16 25 p ## 10 audi a4 quat… 2 2008 4 manual… 4 20 28 p ## # ... with 224 more rows, and 1 more variable: class &lt;chr&gt; The function str() will display the “structure” of the data frame. It will display the number of observations and variables, list the variables, give the type of each variable, and show some elements of each variable. This information can also be found in the “Environment” window in RStudio. str(mpg) ## Classes &#39;tbl_df&#39;, &#39;tbl&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 234 obs. of 11 variables: ## $ manufacturer: chr &quot;audi&quot; &quot;audi&quot; &quot;audi&quot; &quot;audi&quot; ... ## $ model : chr &quot;a4&quot; &quot;a4&quot; &quot;a4&quot; &quot;a4&quot; ... ## $ displ : num 1.8 1.8 2 2 2.8 2.8 3.1 1.8 1.8 2 ... ## $ year : int 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 ... ## $ cyl : int 4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 ... ## $ trans : chr &quot;auto(l5)&quot; &quot;manual(m5)&quot; &quot;manual(m6)&quot; &quot;auto(av)&quot; ... ## $ drv : chr &quot;f&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;f&quot; ... ## $ cty : int 18 21 20 21 16 18 18 18 16 20 ... ## $ hwy : int 29 29 31 30 26 26 27 26 25 28 ... ## $ fl : chr &quot;p&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;p&quot; &quot;p&quot; ... ## $ class : chr &quot;compact&quot; &quot;compact&quot; &quot;compact&quot; &quot;compact&quot; ... It is important to note that while matrices have rows and columns, data frames (tibbles) instead have observations and variables. When displayed in the console or viewer, each row is an observation and each column is a variable. However generally speaking, their order does not matter, it is simply a side-effect of how the data was entered or stored. In this dataset an observation is for a particular model-year of a car, and the variables describe attributes of the car, for example its highway fuel efficiency. To understand more about the data set, we use the ? operator to pull up the documentation for the data. ?mpg R has a number of functions for quickly working with and extracting basic information from data frames. To quickly obtain a vector of the variable names, we use the names() function. names(mpg) ## [1] &quot;manufacturer&quot; &quot;model&quot; &quot;displ&quot; &quot;year&quot; ## [5] &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;trans&quot; &quot;drv&quot; &quot;cty&quot; ## [9] &quot;hwy&quot; &quot;fl&quot; &quot;class&quot; To access one of the variables as a vector, we use the $ operator. mpg$year ## [1] 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 ## [15] 2008 1999 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 2008 ## [29] 2008 2008 1999 1999 1999 2008 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 1999 1999 2008 ## [43] 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 2008 1999 ## [57] 1999 1999 2008 2008 2008 1999 2008 1999 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 ## [71] 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 ## [85] 1999 1999 1999 2008 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 ## [99] 2008 1999 1999 1999 1999 1999 2008 2008 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 ## [113] 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 1999 1999 ## [127] 2008 2008 2008 2008 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 1999 2008 1999 2008 2008 ## [141] 1999 1999 1999 2008 2008 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 ## [155] 1999 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 2008 2008 1999 1999 1999 ## [169] 1999 2008 2008 2008 2008 1999 1999 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 ## [183] 2008 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 1999 ## [197] 2008 2008 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 ## [211] 2008 1999 1999 1999 1999 2008 2008 2008 2008 1999 1999 1999 1999 1999 ## [225] 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 mpg$hwy ## [1] 29 29 31 30 26 26 27 26 25 28 27 25 25 25 25 24 25 23 20 15 20 17 17 ## [24] 26 23 26 25 24 19 14 15 17 27 30 26 29 26 24 24 22 22 24 24 17 22 21 ## [47] 23 23 19 18 17 17 19 19 12 17 15 17 17 12 17 16 18 15 16 12 17 17 16 ## [70] 12 15 16 17 15 17 17 18 17 19 17 19 19 17 17 17 16 16 17 15 17 26 25 ## [93] 26 24 21 22 23 22 20 33 32 32 29 32 34 36 36 29 26 27 30 31 26 26 28 ## [116] 26 29 28 27 24 24 24 22 19 20 17 12 19 18 14 15 18 18 15 17 16 18 17 ## [139] 19 19 17 29 27 31 32 27 26 26 25 25 17 17 20 18 26 26 27 28 25 25 24 ## [162] 27 25 26 23 26 26 26 26 25 27 25 27 20 20 19 17 20 17 29 27 31 31 26 ## [185] 26 28 27 29 31 31 26 26 27 30 33 35 37 35 15 18 20 20 22 17 19 18 20 ## [208] 29 26 29 29 24 44 29 26 29 29 29 29 23 24 44 41 29 26 28 29 29 29 28 ## [231] 29 26 26 26 We can use the dim(), nrow() and ncol() functions to obtain information about the dimension of the data frame. dim(mpg) ## [1] 234 11 nrow(mpg) ## [1] 234 ncol(mpg) ## [1] 11 Here nrow() is also the number of observations, which in most cases is the sample size. Subsetting data frames can work much like subsetting matrices using square brackets, [,]. Here, we find fuel efficient vehicles earning over 35 miles per gallon and only display manufacturer, model and year. mpg[mpg$hwy &gt; 35, c(&quot;manufacturer&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)] ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## manufacturer model year ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 honda civic 2008 ## 2 honda civic 2008 ## 3 toyota corolla 2008 ## 4 volkswagen jetta 1999 ## 5 volkswagen new beetle 1999 ## 6 volkswagen new beetle 1999 An alternative would be to use the subset() function, which has a much more readable syntax. subset(mpg, subset = hwy &gt; 35, select = c(&quot;manufacturer&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) Lastly, we could use the filter and select functions from the dplyr package which introduces the pipe operator %&gt;% from the magrittr package. A pipe is a concept from the Unix world, where it means to take the output of some command, and pass it on to another command. This way, one can construct a pipeline of commands. We will see more of this in chapter 2. For additional info on the pipe operator in R, you might be interested in this tutorial. library(dplyr) mpg %&gt;% filter(hwy &gt; 35) %&gt;% select(manufacturer, model, year) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## manufacturer model year ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 honda civic 2008 ## 2 honda civic 2008 ## 3 toyota corolla 2008 ## 4 volkswagen jetta 1999 ## 5 volkswagen new beetle 1999 ## 6 volkswagen new beetle 1999 All three approaches produce the same results. Which you use will be largely based on a given situation as well as user preference. When subsetting a data frame, be aware of what is being returned, as sometimes it may be a vector instead of a data frame. Also note that there are differences between subsetting a data frame and a tibble. A data frame operates more like a matrix where it is possible to reduce the subset to a vector. A tibble operates more like a list where it always subsets to another tibble. 1.7 Programming Basics 1.7.1 Control Flow In R, the if/else syntax is: if (...) { some R code } else { more R code } For example, x = 1 y = 3 if (x &gt; y) { z = x * y print(&quot;x is larger than y&quot;) } else { z = x + 5 * y print(&quot;x is less than or equal to y&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;x is less than or equal to y&quot; z ## [1] 16 R also has a special function ifelse() which is very useful. It returns one of two specified values based on a conditional statement. ifelse(4 &gt; 3, 1, 0) ## [1] 1 The real power of ifelse() comes from its ability to be applied to vectors. fib = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) ifelse(fib &gt; 6, &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;Bar&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Bar&quot; &quot;Bar&quot; &quot;Bar&quot; &quot;Bar&quot; &quot;Bar&quot; &quot;Foo&quot; &quot;Foo&quot; &quot;Foo&quot; Now a for loop example, x = 11:15 for (i in 1:5) { x[i] = x[i] * 2 } x ## [1] 22 24 26 28 30 Note that this for loop is very normal in many programming languages, but not in R. In R we would not use a loop, instead we would simply use a vectorized operation. x = 11:15 x = x * 2 x ## [1] 22 24 26 28 30 1.7.2 Functions So far we have been using functions, but haven’t actually discussed some of their details. function_name(arg1 = 10, arg2 = 20) To use a function, you simply type its name, followed by an open parenthesis, then specify values of its arguments, then finish with a closing parenthesis. An argument is a variable which is used in the body of the function. Specifying the values of the arguments is essentially providing the inputs to the function. We can also write our own functions in R. For example, we often like to “standardize” variables, that is, subtracting the sample mean, and dividing by the sample standard deviation. \\[ \\frac{x - \\bar{x}}{s} \\] In R we would write a function to do this. When writing a function, there are three thing you must do. Give the function a name. Preferably something that is short, but descriptive. Specify the arguments using function() Write the body of the function within curly braces, {}. standardize = function(x) { m = mean(x) std = sd(x) result = (x - m) / std result } Here the name of the function is standardize, and the function has a single argument x which is used in the body of function. Note that the output of the final line of the body is what is returned by the function. In this case the function returns the vector stored in the variable results. To test our function, we will take a random sample of size n = 10 from a normal distribution with a mean of 2 and a standard deviation of 5. (test_sample = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 2, sd = 5)) ## [1] 6.5300978 7.7182338 -1.6020233 11.2812469 -0.5462156 -6.3855205 ## [7] 6.2307789 6.4366239 1.4828505 11.2616951 standardize(x = test_sample) ## [1] 0.3948442 0.5997646 -1.0077205 1.2142853 -0.8256230 -1.8327407 ## [7] 0.3432200 0.3787226 -0.4756656 1.2109131 This function could be written much more succinctly, simply performing all the operations on one line and immediately returning the result, without storing any of the intermediate results. standardize = function(x) { (x - mean(x)) / sd(x) } When specifying arguments, you can provide default arguments. power_of_num = function(num, power = 2) { num ^ power } Let’s look at a number of ways that we could run this function to perform the operation 10^2 resulting in 100. power_of_num(10) ## [1] 100 power_of_num(10, 2) ## [1] 100 power_of_num(num = 10, power = 2) ## [1] 100 power_of_num(power = 2, num = 10) ## [1] 100 Note that without using the argument names, the order matters. The following code will not evaluate to the same output as the previous example. power_of_num(2, 10) ## [1] 1024 Also, the following line of code would produce an error since arguments without a default value must be specified. power_of_num(power = 5) To further illustrate a function with a default argument, we will write a function that calculates sample variance two ways. By default, the function will calculate the unbiased estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\), which we will call \\(s^2\\). \\[ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n - 1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x - \\bar{x})^2 \\] It will also have the ability to return the biased estimate (based on maximum likelihood) which we will call \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\). \\[ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x - \\bar{x})^2 \\] get_var = function(x, biased = FALSE) { n = length(x) - 1 * !biased (1 / n) * sum((x - mean(x)) ^ 2) } get_var(test_sample) ## [1] 33.61722 get_var(test_sample, biased = FALSE) ## [1] 33.61722 var(test_sample) ## [1] 33.61722 We see the function is working as expected, and when returning the unbiased estimate it matches R’s built in function var(). Finally, let’s examine the biased estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\). get_var(test_sample, biased = TRUE) ## [1] 30.2555 "],
["sum.html", "Chapter 2 Working With Data 2.1 Summary Statistics 2.2 Plotting 2.3 Summarizing Two Variables 2.4 The tidyverse 2.5 Example: Importing Excel Data", " Chapter 2 Working With Data In this chapter we will first learn some basic concepts that help summarizing data. Then, we will tackle a real-world task and read, clean, and summarize data from the web. 2.1 Summary Statistics R has built in functions for a large number of summary statistics. For numeric variables, we can summarize data by looking at their center and spread, for example. Make sure to have loaded the ggplot2 library to be able to access the mpg dataset as introduced in section 1.6.7. library(ggplot2) Central Tendency Suppose we want to know the mean and median of all the values stored in the data.frame column mpg$cty: Measure R Result Mean mean(mpg$cty) 16.8589744 Median median(mpg$cty) 17 Spread How do the values in that column vary? How far spread out are they? Measure R Result Variance var(mpg$cty) 18.1130736 Standard Deviation sd(mpg$cty) 4.2559457 IQR IQR(mpg$cty) 5 Minimum min(mpg$cty) 9 Maximum max(mpg$cty) 35 Range range(mpg$cty) 9, 35 Categorical For categorical variables, counts and percentages can be used for summary. table(mpg$drv) ## ## 4 f r ## 103 106 25 table(mpg$drv) / nrow(mpg) ## ## 4 f r ## 0.4401709 0.4529915 0.1068376 2.2 Plotting Now that we have some data to work with, and we have learned about the data at the most basic level, our next tasks will be to visualize it. Often, a proper visualization can illuminate features of the data that can inform further analysis. We will look at four methods of visualizing data by using the basic plot facilities built-in with R: Histograms Barplots Boxplots Scatterplots 2.2.1 Histograms When visualizing a single numerical variable, a histogram is useful. It summarizes the distribution of values in a vector. In R you create one using the hist() function: hist(mpg$cty) The histogram function has a number of parameters which can be changed to make our plot look much nicer. Use the ? operator to read the documentation for the hist() to see a full list of these parameters. hist(mpg$cty, xlab = &quot;Miles Per Gallon (City)&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram of MPG (City)&quot;, # main title breaks = 12, # how many breaks? col = &quot;red&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;) Importantly, you should always be sure to label your axes and give the plot a title. The argument breaks is specific to hist(). Entering an integer will give a suggestion to R for how many bars to use for the histogram. By default R will attempt to intelligently guess a good number of breaks, but as we can see here, it is sometimes useful to modify this yourself. 2.2.2 Barplots Somewhat similar to a histogram, a barplot can provide a visual summary of a categorical variable, or a numeric variable with a finite number of values, like a ranking from 1 to 10. barplot(table(mpg$drv)) barplot(table(mpg$drv), xlab = &quot;Drivetrain (f = FWD, r = RWD, 4 = 4WD)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;, main = &quot;Drivetrains&quot;, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, border = &quot;darkorange&quot;) 2.2.3 Boxplots To visualize the relationship between a numerical and categorical variable, once could use a boxplot. In the mpg dataset, the drv variable takes a small, finite number of values. A car can only be front wheel drive, 4 wheel drive, or rear wheel drive. unique(mpg$drv) ## [1] &quot;f&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;r&quot; First note that we can use a single boxplot as an alternative to a histogram for visualizing a single numerical variable. To do so in R, we use the boxplot() function. The box shows the interquartile range, the solid line in the middle is the value of the median, the wiskers show 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the dots are outliers. boxplot(mpg$hwy) However, more often we will use boxplots to compare a numerical variable for different values of a categorical variable. boxplot(hwy ~ drv, data = mpg) Here used the boxplot() command to create side-by-side boxplots. However, since we are now dealing with two variables, the syntax has changed. The R syntax hwy ~ drv, data = mpg reads “Plot the hwy variable against the drv variable using the dataset mpg.” We see the use of a ~ (which specifies a formula) and also a data = argument. This will be a syntax that is common to many functions we will use in this course. boxplot(hwy ~ drv, data = mpg, xlab = &quot;Drivetrain (f = FWD, r = RWD, 4 = 4WD)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Miles Per Gallon (Highway)&quot;, main = &quot;MPG (Highway) vs Drivetrain&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;darkorange&quot;, border = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) Again, boxplot() has a number of additional arguments which have the ability to make our plot more visually appealing. 2.2.4 Scatterplots Lastly, to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables we will use a scatterplot. This can be done with the plot() function and the ~ syntax we just used with a boxplot. (The function plot() can also be used more generally; see the documentation for details.) plot(hwy ~ displ, data = mpg) plot(hwy ~ displ, data = mpg, xlab = &quot;Engine Displacement (in Liters)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Miles Per Gallon (Highway)&quot;, main = &quot;MPG (Highway) vs Engine Displacement&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) 2.2.5 ggplot All of the above plots could also have been generated using the ggplot function from the already loaded ggplot2 package. Which function you use is up to you, but sometimes a plot is easier to build in base R (like in the boxplot example maybe), sometimes the other way around. ggplot(data = mpg,mapping = aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + geom_point() ggplot is impossible to describe in brief terms, so please look at the package’s website which provides excellent guidance. We will from time to time use ggplot in this book, so try to familiarize yourself with it. Let’s quickly demonstrate how one could customize that first plot: ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ,y=hwy)) + # ggplot() makes base plot geom_point(color=&quot;blue&quot;,size=2) + # how to show x and y? scale_y_continuous(name=&quot;Miles Per Gallon (Highway)&quot;) + # name of y axis scale_x_continuous(name=&quot;Engine Displacement (in Liters)&quot;) + # x axis theme_bw() + # change the background ggtitle(&quot;MPG (Highway) vs Engine Displacement&quot;) # add a title 2.3 Summarizing Two Variables We often are interested in how two (or more!) variables are related to each other. The core concepts here are covariance and correlation. Let’s generate some data on x and y and plot them against each other: Figure 2.1: How are \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) related? Taking as example the data in this plot, the concepts covariance and correlation relate to the following type of question: Given we observe high value of x (like 2, say), can we expect a high or a low value of y, on average? Something like \\(y=2\\) or rather something like \\(y=-2\\)? The answer to this type of question can be addressed by computing the covariance of both variables: cov(x,y) ## [1] 1.041195 Here, this gives a positive number, 1.04, indicating that as one variable lies above it’s average, the other one does as well. In other words, it indicates a positive relationship. What is less clear, however, how to interpret the magnitude of 1.04. Is that a strong or a weak positive association? In fact, we cannot tell. This is because the covariance is measured in the same units as the data, and those units often differ between both variables. There is a better measure available to us though, the correlation, which is obtained by standardizing each variable. By standardizing a variable \\(x\\) one means to divide \\(x\\) by its standard deviation: \\[ z = \\frac{x}{\\sigma_x} \\] The correlation coefficient between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), \\(r_{x,y}\\) is then defined as \\[ r_{x,y} = \\frac{cov(x,y)}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}, \\] and we get rid of the units problem. In R, you can call directly cor(x,y) ## [1] 0.9142495 Now this is better. Given that the correlation has to lie in \\([-1,1]\\), a value of 0.91 is indicative of a rather strong positive relationship for the data in figure 2.1 2.4 The tidyverse Hadley Wickham is the author of R packages ggplot2 and also of dplyr (and also a myriad of others). With ggplot2 he pioneered what he calls the grammar of graphics (hence, gg). Grammar in the sense that there are nouns and verbs and a syntax, i.e. rules of how nouns and verbs are to be put together to construct an understandable sentence. He has extended the grammar idea into various other packages. The tidyverse package is a collection of those packages. tidy data is data where: Each variable is a column Each observation is a row Each value is a cell Fair enough, you might say, that is a regular spreadsheet. And you are right! However, data comes to us not tidy most of the times, and we first need to clean, or tidy, it up. Once it’s in tidy format, we can use the tools in the tidyverse with great efficiency to analyse the data and stop worrying about which tool to use. 2.5 Example: Importing Excel Data The data we will look at is from Eurostat on demography and migration. You should download the data yourself (click on previous link, then drill down to database by themes &gt; Population and social conditions &gt; Demograph and migration &gt; Population change - Demographic balance and crude rates at national level (demo_gind)). Once downloaded, we can read the data with the function read_excel from the package readxl, again part of the tidyverse suite. It’s important to know how the data is organized in the spreadsheet. Open the file with Excel to see: There is a heading which we don’t need. There are 5 rows with info that we don’t need. There is one table per variable (total population, males, females, etc) Each table has one row for each country, and one column for each year. As such, this data is not tidy. Now we will read the first chunk of data, from the first table: total population: library(readxl) # load the library # Notice that if you installed the R package of this book, # you have the data file installed at # `system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;,&quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;)` # otherwise: # * download the file to your computer # * change the argument `path` to where you downloaded it # you may want to change your working directory with `setwd(&quot;your/directory&quot;) # or in RStudio by clicking Session &gt; Set Working Directory # total population in raw format tot_pop_raw = read_excel(path = system.file(package=&quot;ScPoEconometrics&quot;,&quot;datasets&quot;,&quot;demo_gind.xls&quot;), sheet=&quot;Data&quot;, # which sheet range=&quot;A9:K68&quot;) # which excel cell range to read names(tot_pop_raw)[1] &lt;- &quot;Country&quot; # lets rename the first column tot_pop_raw ## # A tibble: 59 x 11 ## Country `2008` `2009` `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Europea… 50029… 50209… 50317… 50296… 50404… 50516… 50701… 50854… 51027… ## 2 Europea… 43872… 44004… 44066… 43994… 44055… 44125… 44266… 44366… 44489… ## 3 Europea… 49598… 49778… 49886… 49867… 49977… 50090… 50276… 50431… 50608… ## 4 Euro ar… 33309… 33447… 33526… 33457… 33528… 33604… 33754… 33856… 33988… ## 5 Euro ar… 32988… 33128… 33212… 33152… 33228… 33307… 33459… 33563… 33699… ## 6 Belgium 10666… 10753… 10839… 11000… 11075… 11137… 11180… 11237… 11311… ## 7 Bulgaria 75180… 74671… 74217… 73694… 73272… 72845… 72456… 72021… 71537… ## 8 Czech R… 10343… 10425… 10462… 10486… 10505… 10516… 10512… 10538… 10553… ## 9 Denmark 54757… 55114… 55347… 55606… 55805… 56026… 56272… 56597… 57072… ## 10 Germany… 82217… 82002… 81802… 80222… 80327… 80523… 80767… 81197… 82175… ## # ... with 49 more rows, and 1 more variable: `2017` &lt;chr&gt; This shows a tibble. This is more informative view of a data.frame (it tells us data type, and how many cols and rows). Notice, in particular, that all columns seem to be of type chr, i.e. characters - a string, not a number! We’ll have to fix that, as this is clearly numeric data. 2.5.1 tidyr In the previous tibble, each year is a column name (like 2008) instead of all years being in one column year. We really would like to have several rows for each Country, one per year. We want to gather() all years into a new column to tidy this up - and here is how: specify which columns are to be gathered: in our case, all years (note that paste(2008:2017) produces a vector like [&quot;2008&quot;, &quot;2009&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;,...]) say what those columns should be gathered into, i.e. what is the key for those values: year. Finally, what is the name of the new resulting column, containing the value from each cell: counts. library(tidyr) # for the gather function tot_pop = gather(tot_pop_raw, paste(2008:2017),key=&quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;counts&quot;) Notice that counts is still a chr. Let’s convert it: tot_pop$counts = as.integer(tot_pop$counts) ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion tot_pop ## # A tibble: 590 x 3 ## Country year counts ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 European Union (current composition) 2008 500297033 ## 2 European Union (without United Kingdom) 2008 438725386 ## 3 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 2008 495985066 ## 4 Euro area (19 countries) 2008 333096775 ## 5 Euro area (18 countries) 2008 329884170 ## 6 Belgium 2008 10666866 ## 7 Bulgaria 2008 7518002 ## 8 Czech Republic 2008 10343422 ## 9 Denmark 2008 5475791 ## 10 Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) 2008 82217837 ## # ... with 580 more rows Now you can see that column counts is indeed a int, i.e. an integer number, and we are fine. 2.5.2 dplyr The transform chapter of Hadley Wickham’s book is a great place to read up more on using dplyr. With dplyr you can do the following operations on data.frames and tibbles: Choose observations based on a certain value: filter() Reorder rows: arrange() Select variables by name: select() Create new variables out of existing ones: mutate() Summarise variables: summarise() All of those verbs can be used with group_by(), where we apply the respective operation on a group of the dataframe/tibble. For example, on our tot_pop tibble we will now filter mutate and plot the resulting values Now we can immediately select some countries and plot their population over time. We will make use of the piping syntax of dplyr as already mentioned in section 1.6.7. library(dplyr) # for %&gt;%, filter, mutate, ... tot_pop %&gt;% filter(Country %in% c(&quot;France&quot;,&quot;United Kingdom&quot;,&quot;Italy&quot;,&quot;Germany&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(millions = counts / 1e6) %&gt;% ggplot(mapping = aes(x=year,y=millions,color=Country,group=Country)) + geom_line() Arrange a tibble What are the top/bottom 5 most populated areas? top5 = tot_pop %&gt;% arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;% # arrange in descending order of col `counts` top_n(5) bottom5 = tot_pop %&gt;% arrange(desc(counts)) %&gt;% top_n(-5) top5 ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## Country year counts ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plu… 2017 5.17e8 ## 2 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plu… 2016 5.16e8 ## 3 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plu… 2015 5.14e8 ## 4 European Economic Area (EU27 - before the accession of … 2017 5.13e8 ## 5 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plu… 2014 5.12e8 bottom5 ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## Country year counts ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 San Marino 2015 32789 ## 2 San Marino 2014 32520 ## 3 San Marino 2008 32054 ## 4 San Marino 2011 31863 ## 5 San Marino 2009 31269 Now this is not exactly what we wanted. It’s always the same country in both top and bottom, because there are multiple years per country. Let’s compute average population over the last 5 years and rank according to that: topbottom = tot_pop %&gt;% group_by(Country) %&gt;% filter(year &gt; 2012) %&gt;% summarise(mean_count = mean(counts)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(mean_count)) top5 = topbottom %&gt;% top_n(5) bottom5 = topbottom %&gt;% top_n(-5) top5 ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## Country mean_count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 European Economic Area (EU28 - current composition, plus IS… 514029320 ## 2 European Economic Area (EU27 - before the accession of Croa… 509813491. ## 3 European Union (current composition) 508502858. ## 4 European Union (before the accession of Croatia) 504287028. ## 5 European Union (without United Kingdom) 443638309. bottom5 ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## Country mean_count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Luxembourg 563319. ## 2 Malta 440467. ## 3 Iceland 329501. ## 4 Liechtenstein 37353 ## 5 San Marino 33014. That’s better! Look for NAs in a tibble Sometimes data is missing, and R represents it with the special value NA (not available). It is good to know where in our dataset we are going to encounter any missing values, so the task here is: let’s produce a table that has three columns: the names of countries with missing data how many years of data are missing for each of those and the actual years that are missing missings = tot_pop %&gt;% filter(is.na(counts)) %&gt;% # is.na(x) returns TRUE if x is NA group_by(Country) %&gt;% summarise(n_missing = n(),years = paste(year,collapse = &quot;, &quot;)) knitr:::kable(missings) Country n_missing years Albania 2 2010, 2012 Andorra 2 2014, 2015 Armenia 1 2014 France (metropolitan) 4 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 Georgia 1 2013 Monaco 7 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 Russia 4 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 San Marino 1 2010 Notice that I used the function kable from the knitr package to produce a nicely looking table here. plot different vars make proportions and plot make growth rates and plot plot different vars by country "],
["linreg.html", "Chapter 3 Linear Regression 3.1 Data on Cars 3.2 An Example: California Student Test Scores 3.3 The lm() function", " Chapter 3 Linear Regression 3.1 Data on Cars We will look at the built-in cars dataset. Let’s get a view of this by just typing View(cars) in Rstudio. You can see something like this: ## speed dist ## 1 4 2 ## 2 4 10 ## 3 7 4 ## 4 7 22 ## 5 8 16 ## 6 9 10 We have a data.frame with two columns: speed and dist. Type help(cars) to find out more about the dataset. There you could read that The data give the speed of cars (mph) and the distances taken to stop (ft). It’s good practice to know the extent of a dataset. You could just type dim(cars) ## [1] 50 2 to find out that we have 50 rows and 2 columns. A central question that we want to ask now is the following: 3.1.1 How are speed and dist related? The simplest way to start plot the data. Remembering that we view each row of a data.frame as an observation, we could just label one axis of a graph speed, and the other one dist, and go through our table above row by row. We just have to read off the x/y coordinates and mark them in the graph. In R: plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars, xlab = &quot;Speed (in Miles Per Hour)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Stopping Distance (in Feet)&quot;, main = &quot;Stopping Distance vs Speed&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;red&quot;) Here, each dot represents one observation. In this case, one particular measurement speed and dist for a car. Now, again: How are speed and dist related? How could one best summarize this relationship? One thing we could do, is draw a straight line through this scatterplot, like so: plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars, xlab = &quot;Speed (in Miles Per Hour)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Stopping Distance (in Feet)&quot;, main = &quot;Stopping Distance vs Speed&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = &quot;red&quot;) abline(a = 60,b = 0,lw=3) Now that doesn’t seem a particularly good way to summarize the relationship. Clearly, a better line would be not be flat, but have a slope, i.e. go upwards: That is slightly better. However, the line seems at too high a level - the point at which it crosses the y-axis is called the intercept; and it’s too high. We just learned how to represent a line, i.e. with two numbers called intercept and slope. So how to choose the best line? 3.1.2 Choosing the Best Line Suppose we have the following set of 9 observations on x and y, and we put the best straight line into it, that we can think of. It looks like this: Figure 3.1: The best line and its errors The red arrows indicate the distance of the line to each point and we call them errors or residuals, often written with the symbol \\(\\varepsilon\\). An upward pointing arrow indicates a positive value of a particular \\(\\varepsilon_i\\), and vice versa for downward pointing arrows. The name residual comes from the way we write an equation for this relationship between two particular values \\((y_i,x_i)\\) belonging to observation \\(i\\): \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{3.1} \\] Here \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept, and \\(\\beta_1\\) is the slope of our line, and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is the value of the arrow (i.e. a positive or negative number) indicating the distance between the actual \\(y_i\\) and what is predicted by our line. In other words, \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is what is left to be explained on top of the line \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i\\), hence, it’s a residual to explain \\(y_i\\). Now, back to our claim that this is the best line. What exactly characterizes the best line? The best line minimizes the sum of squared residuals, i.e. it minimizes the SSR: \\[ \\varepsilon_1^2 + \\dots + \\varepsilon_N^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\varepsilon_i^2 \\equiv \\text{SSR}\\] Wait a moment, why squared residuals? This is easy to understand: suppose that instead, we wanted to just make the sum of the arrows in figure 3.1 as small as possible (that is, no squares). Choosing our line to make this number small would not give a particularly good representation of the data – given that errors of opposite sign and equal magnitude offset, we could have very long arrows (but of opposite signs), and a poor resulting line. Squaring each error avoids this (because now negative errors get positive values!) We illustrate this in figure 3.2. This is the same data as in figure 3.1, but instead of arrows of length \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) for each observation \\(i\\), now we draw a square with side \\(\\varepsilon_i\\), i.e. an area of \\(\\varepsilon_i^2\\). You will see in the practical sessions that choosing a different line to this one will increase the sum of squares. Figure 3.2: The best line and its SQUARED errors 3.1.3 Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Coefficients The method to estimate \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) we illustrated above is called Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS. There is a connection between the estimate for \\(\\beta_1\\) - denoted \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) - in equation (3.1) and the covariance of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) - remember how we defined this in section 2.3. In the simple case shown in equation (3.1), the relationship is \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{cov(x,y)}{var(x)}. \\tag{3.2} \\] i.e. the estimate of the slope coefficient is the covariance between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) divided by the variance of \\(x\\). Similarly, the estimate for the intercept is given by \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x}. \\tag{3.3} \\] where \\(\\bar{z}\\) denotes the sample mean of variable \\(z\\). 3.1.4 Correlation, Covariance and Linearity It is important to keep in mind that Correlation and Covariance relate to a linear relationship between x and y. Given how the regression line is estimated by OLS (see just above), you can see that the regression line inherits this property from the Covariance. A famous exercise by Francis Anscombe (1973) illustrates this by constucting 4 different datasets which all have identical linear statistics: mean, variance, correlation and regression line are identical. However, the usefulness of the statistics to describe the relationship in the data is not clear. The important lesson from this example is the following: Always visually inspect your data, and don’t rely exclusively on summary statistics like mean, variance, correlation and regression line. All of those assume a linear relationship between the variables in your data. 3.1.5 Non-Linear Relationships in Data Suppose our data now looks like this: Putting our previous best line defined in equation (3.1) as \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + u\\), we get something like this: Figure 3.3: Best line with non-linear data? Somehow when looking at 3.3 one is not totally convinced that the straight line is a good summary of this relationship. For values \\(x\\in[50,120]\\) the line seems to low, then again too high, and it completely misses the right boundary. It’s easy to address this shortcoming by including higher order terms of an explanatory variable. We would modify (3.1) to read now \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\beta_2 x_i^2 + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{3.4} \\] This is a special case of multiple regression, which we will talk about in chapter 5. You can see that there are multiple slope coefficients. For now, let’s just see how this performs: Figure 3.4: Better line with non-linear data! 3.1.6 Assessing the Goodness of Fit There is a convenient measure for how good our statistical model fits the data. It is called \\(R^2\\), also called the coefficient of determination. There are several equivalent definitions, and for our present case we will use the following: The coefficient of determination is defined by \\[R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SSR from our model}}{\\text{SSR of }y_i = \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i}.\\] In the simple linear model, we have that \\(R^2 \\in [0,1]\\), where \\(R^2 = 1\\) would indicate that our model is a very good fit to the data, and vice versa for \\(R^2 = 0\\). You can interpret the value of \\(R^2\\) as the fraction of variation in outcome \\(y\\) that is accounted for by explanatory variable \\(x\\). You can see in the above definition that this measure relates the quality of our model to a very basic benchmark model, i.e. a model without any regressors: As you will see in the apps to this chapter, the model \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i\\) simply estimates the mean of \\(y\\). Given that the number SSR is a summary of how large a total error we make, and given that this benchmark model is kind of the worst case scenario in this respect, you can see how the \\(R^2\\) statistic will behave: the smaller the SSR from our model in relation to the baseline model, the higher it will be. plot_data = generate_data(sigma = 2,n=4) # op &lt;- par(mfrow=c(1,2),pin=c(2.8,2.5)) op &lt;- par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot_unexp_SSR(plot_data) plot_total_dev(plot_data) par(op) 3.2 An Example: California Student Test Scores Luckily for us, fitting a linear model to some data does not require us to iteratively find the best intercept and slope manually. As it turns out, R can do this much more precisely, and very fast! Let’s explore how to do this, using a real life dataset taken from the Ecdat package which includes many economics-related dataset. In this example, we will use the Caschooldataset which contains the average test scores of 420 elementary schools in California along with some additional information. 3.2.1 Loading and exploring Data We can explore which variables are included in the dataset using the names() function: library(&quot;Ecdat&quot;) # Attach the Ecdat library names(Caschool) # Display the variables of the Caschool dataset ## [1] &quot;distcod&quot; &quot;county&quot; &quot;district&quot; &quot;grspan&quot; &quot;enrltot&quot; &quot;teachers&quot; ## [7] &quot;calwpct&quot; &quot;mealpct&quot; &quot;computer&quot; &quot;testscr&quot; &quot;compstu&quot; &quot;expnstu&quot; ## [13] &quot;str&quot; &quot;avginc&quot; &quot;elpct&quot; &quot;readscr&quot; &quot;mathscr&quot; For each variable in the dataset, basic summary statistics can be obtained by calling summary() summary(Caschool[, c(&quot;testscr&quot;, &quot;str&quot;, &quot;avginc&quot;)]) ## testscr str avginc ## Min. :605.5 Min. :14.00 Min. : 5.335 ## 1st Qu.:640.0 1st Qu.:18.58 1st Qu.:10.639 ## Median :654.5 Median :19.72 Median :13.728 ## Mean :654.2 Mean :19.64 Mean :15.317 ## 3rd Qu.:666.7 3rd Qu.:20.87 3rd Qu.:17.629 ## Max. :706.8 Max. :25.80 Max. :55.328 3.2.2 Fitting a linear model Suppose a policymaker is interested in the following linear model: \\[testscr_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times str_i + \\epsilon_i\\] Where \\((testscr)_i\\) is the average test score for a given school \\(i\\) and \\((str)_i\\) is the Student/Teacher Ratio (i.e. the average number of students per teacher) in the same school \\(i\\). We can think of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) as the intercept and the slope of the regression line. The subscript \\(i\\) indexes all unique elementary schools (\\(i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots 420\\}\\)) and \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is the error, or residual, of the regression. (Remember that our procedure for finding the line of best fit is to minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR)). At this point you should step back and take a second to think about what you believe the relation between a school’s test scores and student/teacher ratio will be. Do you believe that, in general, a high student/teacher ratio will be associated with higher-than-average test scores for the school? Do you think that the number of students per teacher will impact results in any way? Let’s find out! As always, we will start by plotting the data to inspect it visually (don’t worry if the syntax doesn’t make much sense right now, we will come back to it very soon): plot(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool, xlab = &quot;Student/Teacher Ratio&quot;, ylab = &quot;Average Test Score&quot;, pch = 21, col = &#39;blue&#39;) Figure 3.5: Student Teacher Ratio vs Test Scores Can you spot a trend in the data? According to you, what would the line of best fit look like? Would it be upward or downward slopping? Let’s ask R! 3.3 The lm() function We will use the built-in lm() function to estimate the coefficients \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) using the data at hand. lm stands for linear model, which is what our representation in (3.1) amounts to. This function typically only takes 2 arguments, formula and data: lm(formula, data) formula is the description of our model which we want R to estimate for us. Its syntax is very simple: Y ~ X (more generally, DependentVariable ~ Independent Variables). You can think of the tilda operator ~ as the equal sign in your model equation. An intercept is included by default and so you do not have to ask for it in formula. For example, the simple model \\(income = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot age\\) can be written as income ~ age. You can also ask R to estimate a multivariate regression such as \\(income = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot age + \\beta_2 \\cdot isWoman\\) by simply separating all variables on the right-hand side of the equation with the + operator, like this : income ~ age + isWoman. A formula can sometimes be written between quotation marks: &quot;X ~ Y&quot;. data is simply the data.frame containing the variables in the model. In the context of our example, the function call is therefore: lm(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) str ## 698.93 -2.28 As we can see, R returns its estimates for the Intercept and Slope coefficients, \\(\\hat{\\beta_0} =\\) 698.93 and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1} =\\) -2.28. The estimated relationship between a school’s Student/Teacher Ratio and its average test results is negative. Running a linear regression in R is typically a two-steps process. You first assign the output of the lm() call to an object and then call a second function (for our purpose, mainly summary()) on the resulting object. In practice, this looks like this : # assign lm() output to some object `fit_california` fit_california &lt;- lm(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool) # ask R for the regression summary summary(fit_california) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -47.727 -14.251 0.483 12.822 48.540 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

This output is called a regression table, and you will be able to decypher it by the end of this course. 3.3.1 Plotting the regression line We can also use our lm fit to draw the regression line on top of our initial scatterplot, using the following syntax: plot(formula = testscr ~ str, data = Caschool, xlab = &quot;Student/Teacher Ratio&quot;, ylab = &quot;Average Test Score&quot;, pch = 21, col = &#39;blue&#39;)# same plot as before abline(fit_california, col = &#39;red&#39;) # add regression line Figure 3.6: Test Scores with Regression Line As you probably expected, the best line for schools’ Student/Teacher Ratio and its average test results is downward sloping.

["std-errors.html", "Chapter 4 Standard Errors 4.1 DGP and Models", " Chapter 4 Standard Errors In the previous chapter we have seen how the OLS method can produce estimates about intercept and slope coefficients from data. You have seen this method at work in R by using the lm function as well. It is now time to introduce the notion that given that \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) are estimates, there is some degree of uncertainty about their values. An other way to say this is that we want some indication about the precision of those estimates. How confident should we be about the estimated values \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\)? The discussion here is closely linked to the practical exercise that you did by typing library(ScPoEconometrics) launchApp(&quot;standard_errors_simple&quot;) # and launchApp(&quot;standard_errors_changeN&quot;) # and which illustrated that every time one regenerates a random sample from a given data-generating process, one finds slightly different values for the mean (and other statistics). Given that \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) are as well just statistics computed from the data, the same fact will apply. One question you should ask now, however, is: What exactly is a data generating process (or short, a GDP)? And what do \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) have to do with it? 4.1 DGP and Models When we talk about a model in econometrics, we are making assumptions about how \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are related in the data. For example, we have repeatedly seen the following equation, \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{3.4} \\] which is a particular kind of model. What generated our data, on the other hand, is an unknown mechanism that we want to investigate: it’s the data generating process, and our model is our assumption about how we think the GDP could look like. A first order concern is that our model in (3.4) might not be a particularly good model for the GDP at hand. How would that impact our estimates for \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\)? And what’s the interpretation of the error \\(\\varepsilon\\) now? missing variables go into error more observations allow to generate better estimates "],
["multiple-reg.html", "Chapter 5 Multiple Regression 5.1 California Test Scores 2", " Chapter 5 Multiple Regression We can extend the discussion from chapter 3 to more than one explanatory variable. For example, suppose that instead of only \\(x\\) we now had \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in order to explain \\(y\\). Everything we’ve learned for the single variable case applies here as well. Instead of a regression line, we now get a regression plane, i.e. an object representable in 3 dimenions: \\((x_1,x_2,y)\\). As an example, suppose we wanted to explain how many miles per gallon (mpg) a car can travel as a function of its horse power (hp) and its weight (wt). In other words we want to estimate the equation \\[ mpg_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 hp_i + \\beta_2 wt_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{5.1} \\] on our built-in dataset of cars (mtcars): subset(mtcars, select = c(mpg,hp,wt)) ## mpg hp wt ## Mazda RX4 21.0 110 2.620 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 110 2.875 ## Datsun 710 22.8 93 2.320 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 110 3.215 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 175 3.440 ## Valiant 18.1 105 3.460 ## Duster 360 14.3 245 3.570 ## Merc 240D 24.4 62 3.190 ## Merc 230 22.8 95 3.150 ## Merc 280 19.2 123 3.440 ## Merc 280C 17.8 123 3.440 ## Merc 450SE 16.4 180 4.070 ## Merc 450SL 17.3 180 3.730 ## Merc 450SLC 15.2 180 3.780 ## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 205 5.250 ## Lincoln Continental 10.4 215 5.424 ## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 230 5.345 ## Fiat 128 32.4 66 2.200 ## Honda Civic 30.4 52 1.615 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 65 1.835 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 97 2.465 ## Dodge Challenger 15.5 150 3.520 ## AMC Javelin 15.2 150 3.435 ## Camaro Z28 13.3 245 3.840 ## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 175 3.845 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 66 1.935 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 91 2.140 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 113 1.513 ## Ford Pantera L 15.8 264 3.170 ## Ferrari Dino 19.7 175 2.770 ## Maserati Bora 15.0 335 3.570 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 109 2.780 How do you think hp and wt will influence how many miles per gallon of gasoline each of those cars can travel? In other words, what do you expect the signs of \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) to be? With two explanatory variables as here, it is still possible to visualize the regression plane, so let’s start with this as an answer. The OLS regression plane through this dataset looks like in figure 5.1: Figure 5.1: Multiple Regression - a plane in 3D This visualization shows a couple of things: the data are shown with red points, the grey plane is the one resulting from OLS estimation of equation (5.1), and the red lines show the size of the error between estimated plane and observed data. You should realize that this is exactly the same story as told in figure 3.1 - just in three dimensions! We can see from this plot that cars with more horse power and greater weight, in general travel fewer miles per gallon of combustible. Hence, we observe a plane that is downward sloping in both the weight and horse power directions. Suppose now we wanted to know impact of hp on mpg in isolation, so as if we could ask Keeping the value of wt fixed for a certain car, what would be the impact on mpg be if we were to increase only its hp? Put differently, keeping all else equal, what’s the impact of changing hp on mpg? We ask this kind of question all the time in econometrics. In figure 5.1 you clearly see that both explanatory variables have a negative impact on the outcome of interest: as one increases either the horse power or the weight of a car, one finds that miles per gallon decreases. What is kind of hard to read off is how negative an impact each variable has in isolation. The kind of question asked here is so common that indeed it has got its own name: we’d say “ceteris paribus, what is the impact of hp on mpg?”. ceteris paribus is latin and means the others equal, i.e. all other variables fixed. To answer the question, thus, multiple regression to the rescue: ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -3.941 -1.600 -0.182 1.050 5.854 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

You can interpret this as follows: Holding all other variables fixed at their observed values - or ceteris paribus - a one unit increase in wt implies a -3.87783 units change in mpg. Similarly, one more hp horse power implies a change in mpg of -0.03177 units, all else (i.e. wt) equal. 5.1 California Test Scores 2 With the tools introduced in 3.2 it is fairly straigtforward to estimate models with more than one dependent variables, for example adding families’ average income to our previous model: \\[testscr_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 str_i + \\beta_2 avginc_i + \\epsilon_i\\] We can incoporate this new variable to our model by simply adding it to our formula: library(&quot;Ecdat&quot;) # reload the data fit_multivariate &lt;- lm(formula = &quot;testscr ~ str + avginc&quot;, data = Caschool) summary(fit_multivariate) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = &quot;testscr ~ str + avginc&quot;, data = Caschool) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -39.608 -9.052 0.707 9.259 31.898 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

["categorical-vars.html", "Chapter 6 Categorial Variables: Dummies and Interactions 6.1 Categorical Variables in R: factor 6.2 Saturated Models", " Chapter 6 Categorial Variables: Dummies and Interactions Up until now, we have encountered only examples with continuous variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), that is, \\(x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), so that a typical observation could have been \\((y_i,x_i) = (1.5,5.62)\\). There are many situations where it makes sense to think about the data in terms of categories, rather than continuous numbers. For example, whether an observation \\(i\\) is male or female, whether a pixel on a screen is black or white, and whether a good was produced in France, Germany, Italy, China or Spain are all categorical classifications of data. Probably the simplest type of categorical variable is the binary, boolean, or just dummy variable. As the name suggests, it can take on only two values, 0 and 1, or TRUE and FALSE. Even though this is an extremely parsimonious way of encoding that, it is a very powerful tool that allows us to represent that a certain observation \\(i\\) is a member of a certain category \\(j\\). For example, we could have a variable called is.male that is TRUE whenever \\(i\\) is male, and FALSE otherwise. A common way to represent this is with the so-called indicator function \\(\\mathbf{1}[\\text{condition}]\\), \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{is.male}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[\\text{sex}_i==\\text{male}], \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] which would just mean \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{1}[\\text{sex}_i==\\text{male}] &amp;= \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is male} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is female}. \\\\ \\end{cases} \\end{align*}\\] Notice the use of x == y to represent the relationship x is equal y, which is (very!) different from x = y meaning assign y to x. In terms of a regression formulation, this is our model: \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i,x_i\\in\\{0,1\\} \\tag{6.1} \\] when our regressor is binary. Let’s run that regression here: ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ x, data = dta) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) x ## 1.889 3.756 We have seen in the app launched via launchApp(&quot;reg_dummy&quot;) that the regression simplifies to the straight line connecting the mean, or the expected value of \\(y\\) when \\(x=0\\), \\(E[y|x=0]\\) to the mean when \\(x=1\\), \\(E[y|x=1]\\). It is useful to remember that the unconditional mean of \\(y\\), i.e. \\(E[y]\\), is going to be the result of regressing \\(y\\) only on an intercept, illustrated by the red line. The red line will always lie in between both conditional means. Let’s just refresh our memory by replicating the graph from the app here in figure 6.1: Figure 6.1: regressing \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) on \\(x \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). The red line is \\(E[y]\\) Now suppose for a moment that in fact \\[ x_i = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is male} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if }i\\text{ is female}. \\\\ \\end{cases} \\] and that \\(y_i\\) is a measure of \\(i\\)’s annual labor income. The dummy variable version of the above regression is just \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\alpha \\text{is.male}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{6.2} \\] where \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{is.male}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==1], \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] and the resulting estimates of \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) are in fact the same. Here we see the estimates from (6.2): ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ is.male, data = dta) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.40227 -0.50683 -0.09763 0.66287 1.53463 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

This equivalence is harder to see if we move beyond binary categorical variables such as TRUE vs FALSE, but consider something like \\(x_i \\in \\{\\text{blue,green,yellow,red}\\}\\). In R parlance, blue, green, yellow, red are the levels of factor \\(x\\). A straightforward extension of the above would dictate to create one dummy variable for each category (or level), like \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{is.blue}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{blue}] \\\\ \\text{is.green}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{green}] \\\\ \\text{is.yellow}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{yellow}] \\\\ \\text{is.red}_i &amp;= \\mathbf{1}[x_i==\\text{red}] \\end{align*}\\] but you can see that this is cumbersome. There is a better solution for us available! R has extensive support for categorical variables built-in. The relevant data type representing a categorical variable, or a dummy, is called factor. We encountered them as basic data types in section 1.5 already, but it is worth repeating this here. We have seen that a factor categorizes a usually small number of numeric values by labels, as in this example which is similar to what I used to create regressor is.male for the above regression: is.male = factor(x = c(0,1,1,0), labels = c(FALSE,TRUE)) is.male ## [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE ## Levels: FALSE TRUE You can see the result is a vector object of type factor with 4 entries, whereby 0 is represented as FALSE and 1 as TRUE. An other example could be if we wanted to record a variable sex instead, and we could do sex = factor(x = c(0,1,1,0), labels = c(&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;)) sex ## [1] female male male female ## Levels: female male You can see that this is almost identical, just the labels are different. 6.1.1 More Levels 6.2 Saturated Models introduce second factor introduce saturation main effects, interactions fully saturated model and redudant interactions "],
