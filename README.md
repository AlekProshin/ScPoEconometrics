1. Chapter 2 *Introduction to R* is copied almost entirely from [appliedstats](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/) by [David Dalpiaz](https://daviddalpiaz.com). I added a couple of practical tasks and made some minor edits. 
1. Chapter 3 is partly based on [appliedstats](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/), but only up to *scatterplots*.
